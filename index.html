    <p> The 
        <span class="bold">Game Boy Color</span>[a] 
        (commonly abbreviated as <span class="bold">GBC</span>) 
        is a

        manufactured by 
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nintendo">Nintendo</a>, 
        which was released in Japan on October 21, 1998
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_Boy_Color#cite_note-7">[6]</a> 
        and to international markets 
        that November. It is the successor to the 
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_Boy">Game Boy</a> 
        and is part of the Game Boy product line.

    <p div="p">
        The GBC features a 
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RGB_color_model">color screen</a> 
        rather than 
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monochrome_monitor">monochrome</a>, 
        but it is not 
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Backlight">backlit</a>. 
        It is slightly thicker and taller and features a slightly smaller screen than the 
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_Boy#Hardware">Game Boy Pocket</a>, 
        its immediate predecessor in the Game Boy line. As with the original Game Boy, 
        it has a custom 
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Processor_(computing)">8-bit processor</a> 
        made by 
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sharp_Corporation">Sharp</a> 
        that is considered a hybrid between the 
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intel_8080">Intel 8080</a>

        The Game Boy Color is part of the 
        <a href="">fifth generation of video game consoles</a>. 
        The GBC's primary competitors in Japan were the 
        <a href="">grayscale</a> 
        16-bit handhelds, 
        <a href="">SNK</a>'s 
        <a href="">Neo Geo</a> 
        Pocket and 
        <a href="">Bandai</a>'s 
        <a href="">WonderSwan</a>, 
        though the Game Boy Color outsold them by a wide margin. SNK and Bandai 
        countered with the 
        <a href="">Neo Geo Pocket Color</a> 
        and the 
        <a href="">WonderSwan Color</a>, 
        respectively, but this did little to change Nintendo's 
        <a href="">sales dominance</a>. 
        With 
        <a href="">Sega</a> 
        discontinuing the 
        <a href="">Game Gear</a> 
        in 1997, the Game Boy Color's only competitor in the United States was its 
        predecessor, the Game Boy, until the short-lived Neo Geo Pocket Color was 
        released in North America in August 1999. The Game Boy and the Game Boy Color 
        combined have sold 118.69 million units worldwide making them the third-
        <a href="">best-selling system of all time</a>.[8][9]
    </p>
    <p>
        On March 23, 2003, the Game Boy Color was discontinued, 
        shortly after the release of the 
        <a href="">Game Boy Advance SP</a>. 
        Its best-selling game is 
        <a href="">Pok√©mon Gold and Silver</a>, 
        which shipped 23 million units worldwide.[10][11]
